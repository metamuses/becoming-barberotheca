# Becoming Barberotheca

Group project for the Project Management and Software Engineering for Cultural
Heritage 2025/26 course.

The repository contains the documents and assets for the project management of
the Barberotheca project, covering the planning and organizational work that
precedes and supports the development of a single system composed of its two
tightly coupled components: the semantic data infrastructure and the dissemination
platform built on top of it.

The landing page of the repository is live at [metamuses.github.io/becoming-barberotheca](https://metamuses.github.io/becoming-barberotheca).

The reference project this work is based on is the Semantic Digital Library
2025/26 course group project, currently under development at [metamuses/barberotheca](https://github.com/metamuses/barberotheca).
